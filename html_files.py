  <div>The book of Genesis forms the foundation for understanding relationships. In the beginning, we see a perfect relationship between Adam and Eve, their equal status as image-bearers of God. Wealso see the tragic fall that fractured their relationship and introduced sin and violence into theworld. As we study these chapters, we will gain insight into how to prevent and address genderbasedviolence in our communities, families, and churches.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:27 states: “So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.” This powerful verse affirms the equal value and dignity of both men and women as image-bearers ofGod. God did not create one gender superior to the other; instead, both were created with unique gifts and purposes to glorify God and serve others.</p>
<p>In Genesis 2, we read how God formed Adam from the dust of the ground and breathed into him the breath of life. God saw that it was not good for Adam to be alone, so he created Eve from Adam’s rib. Adam recognized the special bond between him and Eve, saying, “This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called ‘woman,’ for she was taken out of man” (Genesis 2:23). This powerful statement highlights the intimate and equal relationship between man and woman.</p>
<p>However, the perfect relationship between Adam and Eve was shattered in Genesis 3 when they disobeyed God and sin entered the world. The fall not only affected their spiritual relationship with God but also their relationship with each other. Instead of mutual respect and honor, there was blame-shifting and conflict. In verse 16, God tells Eve, “Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.” This is not a command or a blessing but a statement of the brokenness and injustice that would plague the relationship between men and women throughout history.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that gender-based violence is a painful reality in our society today. It is important to recognize the signs of abuse and provide resources to those who are experiencing it or who want to learn more about how to prevent it. There are organizations and professionals who specialize in helping those who have experienced gender-based violence. We encourage everyone to learnabout the signs of abuse and how to get help if they need it.</p>
<p>However, the promise of a redeemer, in the person of Jesus Christ, offers us hope. The redemptive work of Christ forms a basis upon which we hope and work for restored relationships, where men and women are treated with dignity and respect, free from any form of violence.</p>
<p>So, how can we work towards preventing and addressing gender-based violence in our communities, families, and churches? It starts with recognizing the equal value and dignity of both men and women, as image-bearers of God. We must reject any form of gender-based violence and promote healthy and respectful relationships.</p>
<p>Here are some practical examples of how we can do this:</p>
<p><strong>1. Education:</strong> Education is a powerful tool in preventing gender-based violence. We must teach<br>
our children, teens, and adults about healthy relationships, boundaries, and consent. We must also educate ourselves on the signs of abuse and how to intervene if we suspect that someone is experiencing it.<br>
<p><strong>2. <strong>Support:</strong></strong> We must create safe spaces where individuals who have experienced gender-based violence can receive support and care. This can include counseling, therapy, and support groups.<br>
<p><strong>3. Accountability:</strong> It is essential to hold perpetrators accountable for their actions. We must not tolerate any form of gender-based violence, and we must speak out against it when we see it<br>
happening.</p>

 <div>Text: Genesis 4:1-16</p>
<p>The story of Cain and Abel is one of the earliest stories in the Bible, but it remains a powerful andrelevant story for us today. At its core, this is a story about the dangers of unchecked emotions -jealousy, anger, and violence and the devastating consequences that can result.  As we reflect on this story today, we will consider how it relates to the issue of gender-based violence, and thelessons that we can learn from it.</p>
<p>According to statistics, one out of three women face gender-based violence. This is an alarming number that highlights the urgent need to address this issue. As we delve into the story of Cain and Abel, we will consider how it sheds light on this pervasive problem and how we can work towards a world where all are treated with dignity and respect.</p>
<p>The story begins with Cain and Abel, two brothers who offer sacrifices to God. God accepts Abel’s sacrifice but rejects Cain’s. This rejection triggers Cain’s jealousy and anger, and he becomes obsessed with the idea of getting revenge on his brother. This is a common pattern in cases of gender-based violence - a perpetrator feels threatened by their partner’s independence or success and tries to exert control over them through emotional manipulation or physical violence.</p>
<p>Cain’s jealousy soon turns to deception, manipulation, and deadly violence. He invites Abel out into the fields and kills him, then tries to cover up his crime. He lies to God when asked where Abel is, saying, “I don’t know. Am I my brother’s keeper?”</p>
<p>This kind of deception and manipulation is also common in casesof gender-based violence. Perpetrators may try to isolate their partners from friends and family or use gas lighting and other forms of emotional manipulation to maintain control.</p>
<p>The story of Cain and Abel ends with God punishing Cain for his crime. God says, “What have you done? Your brother’s blood cries out to me from the ground.” Cain is condemned to a life of wandering, with the mark of his sin upon him. This serves as a warning about the consequences of violence - it can have devastating effects not only on the victim, but also on the perpetrator.</p>
<p>Finally, we see that Cain is not truly remorseful for his actions. He asks, “My punishment is more than I can bear. Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.” This lack of accountability and remorse is unfortunately common in cases of gender-based violence. Perpetrators may blame their partners for their violence, or external factors like stress or substance abuse, rather than taking responsibility for their own actions.</p>
<p>We need to reject violence and manipulation, and seek healthy, respectful relationships with our partners. It is important to recognize that gender-based violence affects not only the victim but also the perpetrator and society at large. By taking accountability for our own actions and rejecting violence and manipulation, we can work towards a world where all are treated with dignity and respect.</p>
<p>Let us pray for those who have been affected by gender-based violence, and work to create a world where everyone is safe and free from violence. There are resources available for those affected by gender-based violence, including hotlines, organizations, and local resources. Let us commit to doing our part in ending this pervasive problem and promoting healthy relationships based on mutual respect and understanding.</p>

<p>The story of Hagar is one of the most poignant tales of the Bible. She was a slave, an Egyptian maidservant, who was taken by Abraham and Sarah to be their surrogate mother. Hagar’s story is one of pain, exploitation, and oppression. But it is also a story of hope, perseverance, and God’s care for the oppressed.</p>
<p>The story of Hagar teaches us several lessons that are relevant to us today, especially as we seek to address issues of gender-based violence in our communities.</p>
<h2>I. The Plight of the Oppressed: Hagar’s Experience.</h2>
<p>Hagar was a slave who was forced to have a child with her master, Abraham. She was treated as a mere object, a means to an end. When Hagar became pregnant, Sarah, Abraham’s wife, became jealous and mistreated her. Hagar fled into the wilderness, alone and vulnerable.</p>
<p>But even in her despair, Hagar was not forgotten. An angel of the Lord appeared to her and gave her a message of hope. The angel told Hagar that she would have a son, and that he would be a great nation. The angel also gave Hagar a name for God: “El Roi,” which means “the God who sees me.”</p>
<h2>II. God’s Care for the Oppressed: Hagar’s Encounter with God</h2>
<p>Hagar’s encounter with God is a powerful reminder of God’s care for the oppressed. God saw Hagar in her distress and came to her aid. God promised to be with Hagar and her son, even in the midst of their difficulties. Hagar responded by naming the place where she met God, “Beer-lahai-roi,” which means “the well of the Living One who sees me.”</p>
<p>The story of Hagar speaks to contemporary issues of gender-based violence. Today, we still see women and other marginalized groups being exploited, abused, and oppressed. It is important for us to learn from Hagar’s story and to work for justice and equality. Hagar’s story can help us better understand the experiences of survivors of gender-based violence.</p>
<p>Like Hagar, survivors often feel alone, vulnerable, and forgotten. They may be forced to endure abuse from those who are supposed to care for them and may feel like they have nowhere to turn.</p>
<p>The church has a vital role to play in addressing issues of gender-based violence. We must create safe spaces for survivors to share their stories and receive support. We can also raise awareness about the issue and advocate for policy change. As Christians, we are called to stand with the oppressed and work for justice. This means speaking out against gender-based violence and supporting organizations that work with survivors.</p>
<p>We can also educate ourselves and others about the issue, and challenge societal attitudes and behaviors that contribute to violence. If you experienced gender-based violence, know that God sees you and cares for you. You are not alone, and there is hope for healing and recovery. Seek out resources and support and know that there are people who will stand with you and support you.</p>
<p>Let us remember Hagar’s story and let us be inspired to work for a world where all people are valued and respected, and where gender-based violence is no more.</p>
