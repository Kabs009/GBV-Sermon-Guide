  <div><p>In Islam, the teachings from the Quran and the Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon
him) provide a foundation for understanding relationships and promoting equality and respect
between men and women. It is essential to address and prevent gender-based violence (GBV) -
which includes any act of violence or abuse that is directed against a person based on their gender
- in our communities, families, and mosques.
<p>Allah says in the Quran: “O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made
you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight
of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted.” (Quran 49:13)
This verse emphasizes the equal dignity and worth of men and women, as all humans are created
by Allah, and the true measure of nobility lies in our piety and righteousness.
<p>Another verse highlights the importance of love and mercy in relationships: “And among His signs
is this, that He created for you mates from among yourselves, that you may dwell in tranquility
with them, and He has put love and mercy between your hearts. Verily in that are signs for those
who reflect.” (Quran 30:21) Furthermore, the Quran underscores the importance of cooperation
and shared responsibilities between believing men and women: “The believing men and believing
women are allies of one another. They enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and establish
prayers and give zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger. Those - Allah will have mercy upon them.
Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.” (Quran 9:71)
<p>In a famous Hadith, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: “The best of you are those
who are best to their wives, and I am the best of you to my wives.” (Sunan Ibn Majah 1978)
This Hadith highlights the importance of treating women with kindness, respect, and dignity. The
Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) serves as an exemplary role model for treating women
fairly and compassionately.
<p>However, we must recognize the sad reality that gender-based violence persists in our society
today. It is our responsibility as Muslims to learn about the signs of abuse, help those who are
experiencing it, and work towards creating safe environments free from violence.
The teachings of Islam provide a framework for preventing and addressing gender-based violence
in our communities, families, and mosques. By following the principles of Islam and the example
set by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), we can promote equality, respect, and healthy
relationships between men and women.
<p>Here are some practical steps we can take to work towards this goal:
<ol><li>Education: Knowledge is a powerful tool in preventing gender-based violence. We should
teach our children, teens, and adults about the Islamic principles of respect, compassion, and
the rights and responsibilities of both men and women. We must also educate ourselves and
our communities about the signs of abuse and how to offer support and assistance to those
who need it.</li>
<li>Support: We need to create safe spaces within our mosques and communities where individuals
who have experienced gender-based violence can receive the support, care, and understanding
they need. This may include providing counseling, therapy, and support groups, as well as
connecting them with resources and professionals who specialize in addressing gender-based
violence</li>
<li>Accountability: Holding perpetrators of gender-based violence accountable for their actions
is crucial. We must not tolerate any form of violence or abuse, and we must speak out against it
when we witness it occurring. In doing so, we uphold the teachings of Islam and promote a just
and equitable society.</li>
<li>Empowerment: Encourage and empower women in our communities by providing them
with opportunities to learn, grow, and contribute to the community. This not only fosters an
environment of respect and equality but also strengthens the entire community.</li></ol>
<p>By implementing these practical steps, we can work towards creating a society that is free
from gender-based violence and where men and women are treated with dignity and respect,
as emphasized in the teachings of Islam. Together, we can strive to follow the example set
by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and contribute to a more just and
compassionate world.

 <div> <p>Brothers and sisters, today we will reflect on a powerful and relevant story
from the Quran and Hadith - the story of Qabil and Habil. This is a story about the consequences
of unchecked emotions, particularly anger and violence, and the devastating impact they can have
onindividuals, families, and communities. As we reflect on this story, we will consider how it relates
to our daily lives and the issue of domestic violence in our communities, understanding the
differentforms it takes and working together to address and prevent Gender-Based Violence (GBV).
<p>Lessons from the Story of Qabil and Habil: In the Quran, Allah tells us the story of Qabil and Habil,
the sons of Adam (peace be upon him), who offered sacrifices to Allah. Allah accepted Habil’s
sacrifice but rejected Qabil’s. This rejection triggered Qabil’s anger and jealousy, and he became
obsessed with the idea of getting revenge on his brother. This is a common pattern in cases of
domestic violence, where perpetrators feel threatened by their partner’s independence or success
and try to exert control over them through emotional manipulation or physical violence.
Qabil’s jealousy soon turned to violence. He killed his brother Habil out of envy, and then tried to
cover up his crime. Allah then revealed to Qabil the gravity of his crime, emphasizing the
consequences of violence, which can have devastating effects not only on the victim but also on
the perpetrator and society.
<p>Remorse and Accountability: After committing the murder, Qabil showed remorse for his actions.
His remorse and accountability serve as a reminder for us to take responsibility for our actions. We
must reject violence and seek healthy, respectful relationships with our partners, being proactive
in preventing and addressing GBV in our relationships and communities.
<p>The Exemplary Conduct of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him): Prophet Muhammad (peace
be upon him) emphasized the importance of treating our spouses with respect and kindness. He
said, “The best of you are those who are the best to their wives.” (Tirmidhi) He also demonstrated
his commitment to harmonious relationships through his own actions, setting an example for us to
follow in our own lives.
<p>Practical Solutions and Community Involvement: We must work together to create a world where
everyone is safe and free from violence. This includes promoting awareness of GBV, supporting
victims, and holding perpetrators accountable. As individuals and as a community, we can attend
workshops, seek professional help for anger management and conflict resolution, and encourage
open discussions about GBV within families, mosques, and community organizations.
<p>Conclusion: Brothers and sisters, the story of Qabil and Habil serves as a powerful reminder
of the consequences of unchecked emotions, particularly anger and violence. Domestic violence
and GBV are pervasive problems in our communities, and we must work together to address
and prevent them. By following the example of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and
maintaining empathy and compassion for victims, we can support one another in building healthy,
respectful relationships, and creating a safer and more compassionate environment for all. As we
engage in open dialogue and work towards practical solutions, we can strengthen our community’s
resilience against GBV and contribute to a world where everyone is treated with dignity and respect.
<p>May Allah guide us on the path of righteousness and help us protect and support those who are
affected by violence. Ameen.

    elif khutba_number == 3:
        return """   <div> <p>Brothers and sisters, today’s khutba will address the issue of sexual violence and the importance
of breaking the silence that too often surrounds it. As Muslims, we are guided by the Quran and
the teachings of our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), which provide us with a clear
perspective on this issue.
<p>The Quran tells us that all human beings have been created with dignity and honor (Quran 17:70)
and that we must treat others with kindness and respect (Quran 4:36). Sexual violence, whether it is
physical or emotional, is a violation of this dignity and honor and a betrayal of the trust that should
exist between individuals.
<p>Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) has also taught us about the importance of consent in
sexual relationships. He said, “No one should touch the private parts of another person without their
consent” (Sunan Abu Dawud 2162). This emphasizes the importance of respecting the boundaries
of others and seeking their permission before engaging in any sexual activity.
Muslims, we have a responsibility to speak out against sexual violence and to work towards creating
a safe and respectful society. The Quran tells us to stand up for justice and to be witnesses for Allah
(Quran 4:135). This means that we must not remain silent in the face of injustice and must hold those
who commit sexual violence accountable for their actions.
<p>Furthermore, sexual violence is a global issue that affects people of all genders and ages and can
happen anywhere. We must therefore work towards breaking the silence and creating safe spaces
where survivors can seek help and support.
<p>In order to prevent sexual violence, we should respect the physical boundaries of others and avoid
behavior that may be perceived as disrespectful or harmful. We should also promote healthy
relationships, respect the boundaries of others, and seek their consent before engaging in any
sexual activity. If you or someone you know is affected by sexual violence, please know that you are
not alone. There are resources available to you, such as helplines and support groups.
We should also recognize that sexual violence is not limited to any community or culture. It affects
people of all backgrounds, including our own Muslim community. We must therefore take action to
address this issue within our own community, including specific forms of violence that are prevalent,
such as domestic violence, forced marriage, and female genital mutilation.
<p>In conclusion, sexual violence is a serious issue that must be addressed with empathy, understanding,
and a commitment to justice. As Muslims, we are called to promote healthy relationships, respect
the boundaries of others, and speak out against injustice. Let us pray for all those who have been
impacted by sexual violence and work towards creating a society where all people are treated with
dignity and respect. May Allah guide us all on the path of righteousness. Ameen.
