  <div><p>GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE (GBV) is a global issue that transcends culture, religion, and socio-economic
status. It affects millions of people worldwide, primarily women and girls, but also men and boys. This
sermon guide aims to use the sacred writings of both Christians and Muslims to shed light on the
importance of addressing GBV and the unique role that religious leaders and faith communities can play
in combating it. It relies on the text and context of Christian and Islamic writings to offer insights,
guidance, and practical solutions for tackling GBV. It is intended to provide standard messages for
addressing GBV in faith congregations.
<p>The rationale for this is that religious leaders hold significant influence in their communities, often shaping
societal values and beliefs. As a result, they have a moral responsibility to address GBV, a pervasive issue
that affects countless lives. Faith communities can leverage their existing resources, outreach capabilities,
and moral authority to create a safer environment for those affected by GBV.
Survivors of GBV face numerous challenges, including the physical, emotional, and psychological scars
left by violence. Additionally, they often experience stigma and discrimination, which can exacerbate their
suffering and impede their healing process. By leveraging the power of the pulpit, we can raise awareness
of the hardships they endure and foster empathy and understanding.
<p>It is hoped that by recognizing the critical role they play in addressing GBV, religious leaders and faith
communities shall break the silence about GBV stigma. This can be done through reviving dialogue and
sensitizing religious leaders about GBV and its impact and promoting community involvement in GBV
services, including prevention, support, and recovery. The way religious leaders and GBV survivors relate
is also expected to change. This will lead to the creation of safe spaces within congregations where
survivors can speak up about their problems and receive services. These services include provision of
shelter, food, medical treatment, and referral services for legal and psychological support.
<p>Additionally, an opportunity exists to address the underlying cultural and societal issues that fuel GBV.
This includes addressing the education system to ensure that children are empowered to deal with
GBV. Harmful practices such as early marriage, dowry payment, female genital mutilation and forced wife
inheritance, among other must be revisited with a view of restoring the dignity of girls and women.

 <div><p>Gender-based violence (GBV) is a global issue that affects people of all cultures, religions, and
societies. As religious leaders, it is our responsibility to address this issue and to lead our communities
in the fight against GBV. This chapter will define GBV, identify its various forms, discuss the effects of
GBV, and provide a rationale for why religious leaders must respond to this pressing issue.

<strong>Defining Gender-Based Violence</strong>

<p>Gender-based violence is any act of violence or harm directed at an individual or group based on
their gender. It includes physical, sexual, psychological, emotional, and economic abuse, as well as
threats, coercion, and deprivation of liberty. GBV can occur in public or private settings and affects
people across all ages, races, and socio-economic backgrounds.
<p><strong>Forms of GBV</strong>
<p><ol><li>Physical violence: The intentional use of force to inflict injury, pain, or discomfort on someone.
Examples include hitting, slapping, kicking, choking, or using weapons.
</li>
<li>Sexual violence: Any non-consensual sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, or unwanted
sexual comments or advances. Examples include rape, sexual assault, defilement, and
harassment.
</li>
<li>Emotional or psychological violence: Inflicting emotional harm through manipulation, control,
or humiliation. This may include verbal abuse, belittling, or isolating a person from their support
network.</li>
<li>Economic violence: The control or exploitation of an individualâ€™s financial resources, making
them financially dependent and vulnerable. Examples include withholding money, controlling
household finances, or preventing someone from obtaining employment</li>
<li>Harmful traditional practices: Cultural, religious, or social practices that perpetuate gender
inequality and cause physical or psychological harm. Examples include female genital mutilation,
early and forced marriage, and honor</li></ol>

        return """   <div><p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 1 in 3 (35%) of women worldwide
have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual
violence in their lifetime.
<p>The United Nations reports that 18% of women and girls aged 15-49 have experienced physical
or sexual violence from an intimate partner in the past year (as of 2021).
<p>Globally, around 650 million women alive today were married before their 18th birthday, and
more than 150 million girls are at risk of child marriage by 2030.
<p>The World Health Organization estimates that more than 200 million girls and women alive
today have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM) in 31 countries where the practice is
concentrated.
<p>Gender-based violence is a pervasive issue in Kenya, as it is in many countries around the world.
While accurate and comprehensive statistics can be challenging to obtain due to underreporting,
the available data provides a snapshot of the prevalence and impact of GBV in Kenya.

According to the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS 2014) and UNICEF:
<ul><li>45% of women aged 15-49 have experienced physical violence since the age of 15, and 14% have experienced
sexual violence.</li>
<li>among ever-married women, 39% have experienced physical, sexual, or emotional violence from their spouse, with 25% having experienced
spousal physical violence.</li>
<li>21% of women aged 15-49 have undergone female genital
mutilation (FGM), a harmful traditional practice that is recognized as a form of GBV.</li>
<li>The prevalence of FGM varies greatly among ethnic groups, with some communities
reporting rates as high as 98%.</li>
<li>Early and forced marriage is another form of GBV in Kenya, with 23% of girls married
before the age of 18, and 4% married before the age of 15.</li>
